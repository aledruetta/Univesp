# Kernighan & Ritchie The C Programming Language Exercises

## Chapter 1

[**Exercise 1-1:**](exercise_01_01.c) Run the "hello, world" program on your system. Experiment with
leaving out parts of the program, to see what error messages you get.

[**Exercise 1-2:**](exercise_01_02.c) Experiment to find out what happens when printf's argument string
contains \c, where c is some character not listed above.

[**Exercise 1-3:**](exercise_01_03.c) Modify the temperature conversion program to print a heading
above the table.

[**Exercise 1-4:**](exercise_01_04.c) Write a program to print the corresponding Celsius to Fahrenheit
table.

[**Exercise 1-5:**](exercise_01_05.c) Modify the temperature conversion program to print the table in
reverse order, that is, from 300 degrees to 0.

[**Exercise 1-6:**](exercise_01_06.c) Verify that the expression getchar() != EOF is 0 or 1.

[**Exercise 1-7:**](exercise_01_07.c) Write a program to print the value of EOF.

[**Exercise 1-8:**](exercise_01_08.c) Write a program to count blanks, tabs, and newlines.

[**Exercise 1-9:**](exercise_01_09.c) Write a program to copy its input to its output, replacing each
string of one or more blanks by a single blank.

[**Exercise 1-10:**](exercise_01_10.c) Write a program to copy its input to its output, replacing each
tab by \t, each backspace by \b, and each backslash by \\\\. This makes tabs and
backspaces visible in an unambiguous way.

[**Exercise 1-11:**](exercise_01_11.c) How would you test the word count program? What kinds of input
are most likely to uncover bugs if there are any?

[**Exercise 1-12:**](exercise_01_12.c) Write a program that prints its input one word per line.

[**Exercise 1-13a:**](exercise_01_13a.c) Write a program to print a histogram of the lengths of words in
its input. It is easy to draw the histogram with the bars horizontal; a
vertical orientation is more challenging.

[**Exercise 1-13b:**](exercise_01_13b.c) Write a program to print a histogram of the lengths of words in
its input. It is easy to draw the histogram with the bars horizontal; a
vertical orientation is more challenging.

[**Exercise 1-14:**](exercise_01_14.c) Write a program to print a histogram of the frequencies of
different characters in its input.

[**Exercise 1-15:**](exercise_01_15.c) Rewrite the temperature conversion program to use a function for
conversion.

[**Exercise 1-16:**](exercise_01_16.c) Revise the main routine of the longest-line program so it
will correctly print the length of arbitrarily long input lines, and as much as
possible of the text.

[**Exercise 1-17:**](exercise_01_17.c) Write a program to print all input lines that are longer
than 80 characters.

[**Exercise 1-18:**](exercise_01_18.c) Write a program to remove trailing blanks and tabs from each
line of input, and to delete entirely blank lines.

[**Exercise 1-19:**](exercise_01_19.c) Write a function reverse(s) that reverses the character
string s. Use it to write a program that reverses its input a line at a time.
